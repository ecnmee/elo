# Development Progress

A running, public log of where Elo stands. Full technical detail lives in
[`docs/adr/`](docs/adr); this page is the plain-language version, updated
as things move forward.

---

## Current stage: seven contracts implemented

**What's done:**

- Architecture frozen across three ADRs: hierarchy and contracts, philosophy
  and boundaries, official vocabulary.
- Composer package configured, along with the full quality stack: PHPStan,
  Pint, Pest, and continuous integration.
- First architecture test in place and passing, it automatically fails CI
  if the core ever ends up depending on a specific third-party module,
  turning a written rule into an enforced one.
- The seven public contracts (`Module`, `Resource`, `Blueprint`, `Field`,
  `Action`, `Layout`, `Repository`) implemented as typed skeletons, each
  with unit tests covering their core behavior: Blueprint's immutability,
  Field's identity-separate-from-persistence rule, Module's optional hooks,
  and the five v1 Layout types (Section, Tabs, Grid, Card, Column).

**Next up:**

- The design system (base CSS tokens for the panel).
- The first real Field (`Text`), end to end.
- `PostResource` built end to end on top of the seven contracts.

## Why this page exists

Elo is being built in the open, and its architecture was shaped through an
unusually thorough process before any implementation code was written.
This log exists so anyone following along doesn't need to read every commit
to understand where things stand, it's a shortcut, not a replacement for
the real documentation.

## How to follow more closely

- Star or watch this repository for updates.
- The [ADRs](docs/adr) explain every architectural decision and the reasoning behind it.
